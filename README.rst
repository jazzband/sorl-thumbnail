@nikko: Unfortunately I no longer work with Django so my motivation to keep developing
for sorl-thumbnail is very low. If you are interested in taking over this
project please send an email to mikko@aino.se explaing why you are the perfect
fit for owning this project.

<http://sorl-thumbnail.rtfd.org/>`_

Format preservation has been added. To preserve format set settings.THUMBNAIL_PRESERVE_FORMAT = True.
Gracefully degrades and defaults to using settings.THUMBNAIL_FORMAT.

Applications that currently use sorl should not notice any difference in functionality unless settings.THUMBNAIL_PRESERVE_FORMAT is set explicitly set to True.
